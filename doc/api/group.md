hatch-group(3) - Group
======================

## DESCRIPTION

Group is a central object on hatch. Usually term "group" means "site", or
"subsite". Every other entity belongs to group: Page, Content, Comment, Like,
etc.. Modules could be configured separately for each group, for example we can
configure oauth-twitter module for different groups using different oauth
credentials.
